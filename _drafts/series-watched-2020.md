| ![](/assets/images/series/the-witcher.jpg) | [The Witcher](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5180504/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0) | stopped half way s1e6 | Great performance from Henry Cavill, but too many unneeded changes from the original content that make it B quality tv show while it could be top tier. | 5.5    |
