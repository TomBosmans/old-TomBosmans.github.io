Story is very typical superhero, but I just enjoy the cast.                                                                                                                   |    7.5 |

Still fun.                                                                                                                                    |      7 |

It was the "Final order", but also I hope the "Final episode" unless they get George back... |      6 |
| ![](/assets/images/movies/x-men-apocalypse.jpg    | [X-Men: Apocalypse (2016)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3385516/)                            | Good if the ending wasn't so weak.                                                                                                                                                                      |      7 |

On its own decent but creates plotholes way to big to forgive.                                                              |      6 |
