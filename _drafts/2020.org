    | [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4633694][Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018)]] |      7 | Fun spider-man movie but story goes a little bit over the top even for a superhero movie. |
    | [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5742374][You Were Never Really Here (2017)]]        |    7.5 | Brutal, weird and sweet.                                                                  |

    | Borderlands                                            | finished |      7 | The game still looks good and gunplay feels great, but suffers from too much backtracking and uninteresting story.             |
    | Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun                   | finished |    7.8 | Well crafted and clever game with lovable characters. The story was predictable but in the end did its job.                    |
    | Borderlands 2                                          | finished |      8 | Less backtracking, something that can be considered a story and more fun gunplay makes this a great successor to the original. |
    | Assassin's Creed: Odyssey - Legacy of the First Blade  | finished |      7 | I understand what story it wants to tell, but the execution of it is rather poor. More Odyssey is never bad though!            |
    | Borderlands 2: Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep      | finished |      8 | D&D inspired borderlands campaign is something that I would never have thought about, yet it works perfectly!                  |
    | Borderlands 2: Mr. Torgue's Campaign of Carnage        | finished |      7 | Dissapointing Vault/ending with just more borderlands content. Ok but nothing special.                                         |
    | Borderlands 2: Captain Scarlett and Her Pirate's Booty | finished |      7 | Few fun moments, more borderlands nothing special.                                                                             |
    | Borderlands 2: Creature Slaughterdome                  | finished |    7.5 | Fun and short. Biggest troll side quest(s) with the granny though...                                                           |
    | Borderlands 2: Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel             | finished |    8.5 | Similar to the second one yet different enough. Really enjoyed this one!                                                       |

    | [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3385516][X-Men: Dark Phoenix (2019)]]                           |      6 | The ending of the previous movie makes no sense with the start of this one. On its own decent but creates plotholes way to big to forgive.                                                              |

    | Uncharted 2: Among Thieves  | finished                  |      9 | Improves on the first one and did I mention the characters are great?                                                                           |
    | Halo: Combat Evolved        | finished: Legendary co-op |    8.5 | Plays surprising smooth for such an old game. Enhanced graphics have issues sadly, but are still nice way to play.                              |
    | Broken Lines                | finished                  |      8 | Fun way to do "turn" based strategy.                                                                                                            |
    | Warhammer: Mark of Chaos    | finished                  |    7.5 | Loved this game as a kid, still fun and really captures the warhammer feeling.                                                                  |
    | Grand Theft Auto: Vice City | finished                  |      7 | Controls in vehicles is pretty decent, but in combat is a pain. 8 hours long game extended by you needing to buy assets to progress the story.. |
    | Helldivers                  | "endless" Co-op           |      8 | Starshiptroopers meets Warhammer 40k. Fun game to play co-op, but it is very repetitive                                                         |
    | Anno 1404                   | got convinced to get 1800 |      8 | Fun game that still looks great!                                                                                                                |
