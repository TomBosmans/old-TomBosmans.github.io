| ![](/assets/images/games/borderlands.jpg)                          | Borderlands                                            | finished | The game still looks good and gunplay feels great, but suffers from too much backtracking and uninteresting story.             | 7      |
| ![](/assets/images/games/shadow_tactics.jpg)                       | Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun                   | finished | Well crafted and clever game with lovable characters. The story was predictable but in the end did its job.                    | 7.8    |
| ![](/assets/images/games/borderlands2.jpg)                         | Borderlands 2                                          | finished | Less backtracking, something that can be considered a story and more fun gunplay makes this a great successor to the original. | 8      |
| ![](/assets/images/games/ac-odyssey-legacy-of-the-first-blade.jpg) | Assassin's Creed: Odyssey - Legacy of the First Blade  | finished | I understand what story it wants to tell, but the execution of it is rather poor. More Odyssey is never bad though!            | 7      |
| ![](/assets/images/games/borderlands-2-tiny-tinas-ad.jpg)          | Borderlands 2: Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep      | finished | D&D inspired borderlands campaign is something that I would never have thought about, yet it works perfectly!                  | 8      |
| ![](/assets/images/games/borderlands2-campaign-of-carnage.jpg)     | Borderlands 2: Mr. Torgue's Campaign of Carnage        | finished | Dissapointing Vault/ending with just more borderlands content. Ok but nothing special.                                         | 7      |
| ![](/assets/images/games/borderlands2-captain-scarlett.jpg)        | Borderlands 2: Captain Scarlett and Her Pirate's Booty | finished | Few fun moments, more borderlands nothing special.                                                                             | 7      |
| ![](/assets/images/games/borderlands-2-create-slaughter-dome.jpg)  | Borderlands 2: Creature Slaughterdome                  | finished | Fun and short. Biggest troll side quest(s) with the granny though...                                                           | 7.5    |
| ![](/assets/images/games/borderlands-the-pre-sequel.jpg)           | Borderlands 2: Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel             | finished | Similar to the second one yet different enough. Really enjoyed this one!                                                       | 8.5    |

| ![](/assets/images/games/ryse.jpg)       | Ryse: Son of Rome                               | finished | Decent story, amazing graphics but repetitive gameplay. The game seems to be aware of its flaw and tries to limit the damage it does, resulting in a pretty decent game.  | 7      |
| ![](/assets/images/games/claptastic.jpg) | Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel - Claptastic Voyage | finished | More Pre-Sequel can't be bad can it? Worth while dlc.                                                                                                                     | 8      |
| ![](/assets/images/games/gta5.jpg)       | Grand Theft Auto V                              | finished | The game is best when it is linear, the open world is pretty bland when there are no quests left.  Also who thought it would be fun to stack containers or mop a floor... | 8      |
| ![](/assets/images/games/uncharted.jpg)  | Uncharted: Drake's Fortune                      | finished | Amazing flow, great characters = really fun game.                                                                                                                         | 9      |

| ![](/assets/images/games/uncharted2.jpg)    | Uncharted 2: Among Thieves  | finished                    | Improves on the first one and did I mention the characters are great?                                                                         | 9      |
| ![](/assets/images/games/halo-ce.jpg)       | Halo: Combat Evolved        | finished: Legendary co-op   | Plays surprising smooth for such an old game. Enhanced graphics have issues sadly, but are still nice way to play.                              | 8.5    |
| ![](/assets/images/games/broken-lines.jpg)  | Broken Lines                | finished                    | Fun way to do "turn" based strategy.                                                                                                            | 8      |
| ![](/assets/images/games/mark-of-chaos.jpg) | Warhammer: Mark of Chaos    | Playing: 2nd campaign chaos | Loved this game as a kid, still fun and really captures the warhammer feeling.                                                                  | 7.5    |
| ![](/assets/images/games/gta-vice-city.jpg) | Grand Theft Auto: Vice City | Playing                     | Controls in vehicles is pretty decent, but in combat is a pain. 8 hours long game extended by you needing to buy assets to progress the story.. | 7      |
| ![](/assets/images/games/helldivers.jpg)    | Helldivers                  | "endless" Co-op             | Starshiptroopers meets Warhammer 40k. Fun game to play co-op, but it is very repetitive                                                         | 8      |
