| ![borderlands](/assets/images/games/borderlands.jpg)       | Borderlands                          | finished | The game still looks good and gunplay feels great, but suffers from too much backtracking and uninteresting story.             | 7      |
| ![shadow tactics](/assets/images/games/shadow_tactics.jpg) | Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun | finished | Well crafted and clever game with lovable characters. The story was predictable but in the end this its job.                   | 7.8    |
| ![borderlands 2](/assets/images/games/borderlands2.jpg)    | Borderlands 2                        | finished | Less backtracking, something that can be considered a story and more fun gunplay makes this a great successor to the original. | 8      |
