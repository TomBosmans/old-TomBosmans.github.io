| ![](/assets/images/games/borderlands.jpg)                          | Borderlands                                            | finished | The game still looks good and gunplay feels great, but suffers from too much backtracking and uninteresting story.             | 7      |
| ![](/assets/images/games/shadow_tactics.jpg)                       | Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun                   | finished | Well crafted and clever game with lovable characters. The story was predictable but in the end did its job.                    | 7.8    |
| ![](/assets/images/games/borderlands2.jpg)                         | Borderlands 2                                          | finished | Less backtracking, something that can be considered a story and more fun gunplay makes this a great successor to the original. | 8      |
| ![](/assets/images/games/ac-odyssey-legacy-of-the-first-blade.jpg) | Assassin's Creed: Odyssey - Legacy of the First Blade  | finished | I understand what story it wants to tell, but the execution of it is rather poor. More Odyssey is never bad though!            | 7      |
| ![](/assets/images/games/borderlands-2-tiny-tinas-ad.jpg)          | Borderlands 2: Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep      | finished | D&D inspired borderlands campaign is something that I would never have thought about, yet it works perfectly!                  | 8      |
| ![](/assets/images/games/borderlands2-campaign-of-carnage.jpg)     | Borderlands 2: Mr. Torgue's Campaign of Carnage        | finished | Dissapointing Vault/ending with just more borderlands content. Ok but nothing special.                                         | 7      |
| ![](/assets/images/games/borderlands2-captain-scarlett.jpg)        | Borderlands 2: Captain Scarlett and Her Pirate's Booty | finished | Few fun moments, more borderlands nothing special.                                                                             | 7      |
| ![](/assets/images/games/borderlands-2-create-slaughter-dome.jpg)  | Borderlands 2: Creature Slaughterdome                  | finished | Fun and short. Biggest troll side quest(s) with the granny though...                                                           | 7.5    |
| ![](/assets/images/games/borderlands-the-pre-sequel.jpg)           | Borderlands 2: Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel             | finished | Similar to the second one yet different enough. Really enjoyed this one!                                                       | 8.5    |

| ![](/assets/images/games/ryse.jpg)       | Ryse: Son of Rome                               | finished | Decent story, amazing graphics but repetitive gameplay. The game seems to be aware of its flaw and tries to limit the damage it does, resulting in a pretty decent game. | 7      |
| ![](/assets/images/games/claptastic.jpg) | Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel - Claptastic Voyage | finished | More Pre-Sequel can't be bad can it? Worth while dlc.                                                                                                                    | 8      |
